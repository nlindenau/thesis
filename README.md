## About the project - RVAL

RVAL is a simple API, helping you to check nutrition facts of your meal. It takes a list of ingredients and their weights, and returns a nutrition facts label for the entire meal. 

RVAL stands for Ravintoarvolaskuri, or in English: Nutrition Facts Calculator. RVAL supports queries in English, Finnish and Swedish.

RVAL uses [Fineli](https://fineli.fi/fineli/en/index) and its [API](https://fineli.fi/fineli/fi/avoin-data?) (in Finnish) as the source of data. Fineli and its API are maintained by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

This project is part of my Master's thesis at Centria UAS.
